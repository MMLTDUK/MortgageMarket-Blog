As we enter the peak season for the housing market, the mortgage market in the UK remains robust and resilient. The longer days and warmer weather have spurred many individuals to embark on their homebuying journeys, resulting in a surge of activity in the housing sector.

Traditionally, this time of year sees a modest increase of around 1% in asking prices as sellers anticipate a larger pool of potential buyers. However, this month has witnessed an exceptional rise, with prices soaring nearly double the average. In May, the average asking price for a home in Great Britain experienced a staggering 1.8% increase, propelling prices to an all-time high of Â£372,894.

This significant monthly upswing comes after a period of speculation surrounding the housing market's future. Towards the end of 2022 and the beginning of this year, some prospective buyers put their plans on hold due to uncertainties surrounding mortgage rates and the broader economic landscape, including potential changes to the Bank of England's Base Rate and their potential impact on housing prices. To gain insight into current mortgage rates in the UK and their implications for monthly repayments, refer to reliable sources.

Contrary to those concerns, the demand from prospective homebuyers has consistently surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with a notable increase of 3% in the number of people inquiring about properties for sale.

Offering expert analysis, Tim Bannister, our property specialist, explains, "This month's surge in new seller asking prices reflects a delayed reaction and indicates growing seller confidence. Typically, such a substantial monthly increase would occur earlier in the spring season. Increased confidence could be attributed to the fact that the gloomy predictions for the housing market earlier this year are appearing increasingly unlikely."

He further adds, "What is far more probable is that the market will gradually transition to a more normalized level of activity this year, following the exceptional surge in home-moving during the pandemic years."

## hat does this mean if you're thinking of selling your home?
We're now in a much steadier housing market than we have been in recent years. If you're looking to put your home on the market soon, the guidance from estate agents is to make sure it's priced right first time, to avoid the need for a reduction later. Homes that are priced in line with the current market trends are the ones that are getting interest from buyers.

"The market is still very price-sensitive and it is important that new sellers do not damage their prospects of a sale by overpricing initially and reducing later, with agents reporting that it's the realistically-priced new instructions that are selling best," Tim adds.

## And what if you're a first-time buyer?
We've seen the average rates for fixed-rate mortgages steadying over recent weeks, and demand for first-time buyer-type homes up 6% when compared to the same period in 2019. If you're thinking of buying your first home but aren't sure where to start, our guide to buying a home is a good place to start.

In conclusion, the mortgage market in the UK is flourishing as housing prices soar to unprecedented heights. Despite earlier concerns, the demand from buyers remains strong, reflecting the overall confidence in the market's stability. Whether you are considering selling your property or embarking on your first home purchase, now is an opportune time to make your move.
