Greater Manchester has announced plans to invest £97m in improving the energy efficiency of social housing. The investment is set to benefit 5,482 homes in the region, with the average annual energy bill projected to decrease by £276.78 per household.

The investment will come from a £37m grant from the UK government’s Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund, with an additional £60m coming from local councils and housing associations. The retrofit work will involve installing improved insulation, air source heat pumps, solar panels, draught-proofing, ventilation and heating controls.

Most of the homes to benefit from the funding will be in Manchester, where almost a third of properties are social housing. Labour Councillor Gavin White said that a total of 3,129 homes in the city will benefit from this investment, which will "reduce carbon emissions, bring cheaper bills for our residents and ... provide better housing."

The work is expected to save 26,895,921 kWh of energy per year, and should be completed by September 2025. Manchester council will receive £11m towards retrofitting its housing stock, and has also successfully bid for a further £10m in funding from the government’s Home Upgrade Grant 2, which will help fund improvements to approximately 500 privately-owned homes across the city.

The Greater Manchester Combined Authority led a consortium of 18 registered providers of social housing from across the city-region in its successful bid for the £37m grant. The partner organisations have committed a further £60m of their own funding towards the project.

The investment in improving the energy efficiency of social housing in Greater Manchester is an important step towards achieving the region’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2038. It will also help to reduce energy bills for some of the most vulnerable families in the area, and support the growth of the retrofit employment sector.

In conclusion, this investment is a positive step towards a more sustainable future for Greater Manchester, and it is hoped that other regions in the UK will follow suit in their efforts to combat climate change and improve energy efficiency.
