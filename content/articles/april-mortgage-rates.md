If you're considering purchasing a home in the UK, it's essential to stay up-to-date on current mortgage rates. Lenders change the rates of their mortgage products regularly, and it's crucial to be aware of these changes to make informed decisions when choosing a mortgage product.

According to recent reports, the Bank of England (BoE) has increased the Base Rate to 4.25% from 4% in February. Our mortgage expert, Matt Smith, noted that average mortgage rates have crept down again this week, but the pace of change has slowed a bit, with the most significant reduction being 0.10% for 95% 2-year fixed deals.

Despite this slow-down, there are signs of competition at lower loan-to-value (LTV) percentages, with nine lenders offering 5-year fixed-rate deals below 4% at 60% LTV. Additionally, two lenders are now offering a sub-4% 5-year fixed rate to those with a 25% deposit. This is the first time that a high-street lender has offered a 75% LTV rate below the 4% mark since mid-September last year.

Here are the current average fixed-term mortgage rates for home-buyers based on LTV percentages and deposit amounts:

Average fixed-term mortgage rates for home-buyers with 5-10% deposits:

- 95% 2-year fixed: 5.52%
- 95% 5-year fixed: 5.06%
-  90% 2-year fixed: 5.14%
- 90% 5-year fixed: 4.75%

Average fixed-term mortgage rates for home-buyers with 15-25% deposits:
- 85% 2-year fixed: 4.89%
- 85% 5-year fixed: 4.50%
- 75% 2-year fixed: 4.60%
- 75% 5-year fixed: 4.28%

Average fixed-term mortgage rates for home-buyers with 40% deposits:
- 60% 2-year fixed: 4.50%
- 60% 5-year fixed: 4.17%

It's important to note that the amount you can borrow with a mortgage is determined by an affordability assessment, and your interest rate is determined by the amount of deposit you have, or LTV. The larger your deposit, the lower your LTV, and vice-versa.

To find out how much you could borrow and get a personalized result, you can use a mortgage calculator or apply for a Mortgage in Principle, which will take you one step closer to a mortgage offer.

In summary, although mortgage rates have slowed down, there are still plenty of competitive rates available, and it's essential to stay informed and compare mortgage products to find the best deal for you.
